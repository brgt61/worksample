This repository contains selected **research-style project samples** in biomedical engineering, with emphasis on **measurement physics, modeling-guided design, and interpretable analysis**.

## Selected Projects

### Computational Microscope — Forward Modeling & Inverse Reconstruction
**Focus:** computational imaging, forward/inverse models, system-level simulation  
A modeling-driven computational microscopy project exploring forward image formation, inverse reconstruction, and sensitivity to model mismatch.  
→ `computational-microscope/`

### Wearable fNIRS for ADHD — Modeling-Guided Design & Safety Analysis
**Focus:** optical sensing physics, thermal safety, design trade-offs  
A modeling-driven study evaluating feasibility and safety constraints of a wearable fNIRS system for prefrontal cortex monitoring in ADHD.  
→ `fnirs-adhhd/`

---

### Lipidomics Data Analysis & Statistical Modeling
**Focus:** statistical testing, dimensionality reduction, interpretable ML  
A computational analysis pipeline for group-wise lipidomics comparison, including PCA/t-SNE, differential analysis, and decision-tree-based interpretation.  
→ `lipidomics-analysis/`

## Notes

- Code and data availability vary by project due to research constraints.
- Projects are selected to highlight **problem formulation, modeling choices, and analytical reasoning**, rather than polished end-user products.
